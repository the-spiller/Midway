                    The Game
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midway is is a two-player, turn-based, double-blind World War II historical simulation wargame. It 
                    is based on a landmark battle that occurred in early June, 1942 between forces of the United
                    States Navy Pacific Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy Combined Fleet. It will give players an idea of the 
                    challenges that faced the commanders of the opposing fleets, but without so much detail that it is difficult to 
                    learn to play. This is a balancing act that results in some historical elements being 
                    overlooked&mdash;for example, destroyers and submarines have been left out of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game system is not particularly original; it's been tweaked, but veteran board wargamers will recognize 
                    it immediately.
                </p>

                    Each player takes a side: Japan&rsquo;s forces commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, or those of the United 
                    States under the command of Admiral Chester Nimitz. Players direct the movement and combat of the 
                    ships and aircraft actually present for the battle (except, of course, those destroyers and submarines mentioned 
                    above).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first glance, the game might appear to be a more sophisticated version of Battleship, and that&rsquo;s not 
                    far wrong. Most of the game is played on a map of the central Pacific around Midway Atoll on which
                    each player sees only their own ships and airfields. The map has a square grid (about 20 miles to a side) that&rsquo;s 
                    used to control movement and determine range. Players have a limited number of searches available each turn that they 
                    use by selecting grid locations. When enemy ships are located, only their types&mdash;battleship, aircraft carrier, 
                    cruiser, etc.&mdash;are revealed. No infomation on the number of each type present is given, nor anything about any 
                    specific ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is played in turns representing two hours in daylight or five hours at night. It begins at     
                    0500 3 June 1942, and runs out 34 turns later at 1700 on 6 June. The game ends when this last 
                    turn is completed or when either player chooses to retire. The winner is determined by points given for control 
                    of Midway Atoll and the destruction of enemy ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each turn is divided into phases: movement, search, air operations planning, air operations execution, 
                    Midway reduction, and surface combat (each is described in more detail below). In a given turn some phases might 
                    not happen; e.g. if neither player plans air 
                    operations, there will be no air operations execution phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combat can occur in two ways. Usually it&rsquo;s air operations attack missions: sending aircraft that are 
                    available and in range to attack a grid square containing enemy ships. Should ships of both players 
                    wind up sharing one square on the map grid, ship-to-ship surface combat ensues, but this is quite unusual (and 
                    never happened during the actual battle).

                    <span class="i">Kido Butai</span></a> put the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Pacific Fleet battleline on the harbor bottom, 
                    announcing with convincing violence that a modern naval air arm trumped the traditional big-gun battleships 
                    of the world&rsquo;s navies. In one of those ironies that litter military history, this demonstration 
                    of the effectiveness of naval air power came while the U.S. fleet&rsquo;s carriers were safely away from Pearl.

                    While America scrambled to assemble men and mat&#233;riel to fight this war, Thailand, Malaya, Guam, Wake Island 
                    and the Philippines fell to Japanese invaders. Imperial Japan now threatened Australia and had built up a strong 
                    protective screen for their 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere" target="_blank">
                    Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>. Should Hawaii fall, the Pacific Ocean might as well 
                    be a Japanese lake.

                <p>
                    Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen came to believe themselves invincible. Much like today&rsquo;s radical 
                    <span class="i">mujahideen</span>, they believed that Americans were spoiled and weak and lacked the will to 
                    effectively respond.

                <p>        
                    In April, a bright spot emerged for the U.S. and her allies. A Pacific Fleet task force, including 
                    one of the aircraft carriers that the Pearl Harbor attack missed, snuck close to the Japanese home islands 
                    and launched sixteen Army B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers against Tokyo and other Japanese 
                    cities&mdash;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" target="_blank">Doolittle Raid</a>. Little 
                    real damage was done, but the raid accomplished its primary goal of raising American morale at a time when it was 
                    at its lowest. More, it embarassed and enraged Japanese military leaders!

                <p>
                    Imperial Navy Combined Fleet  
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" target="_blank">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto</a> 
                    knew he must complete the job begun at Pearl Harbor&mdash;he must finish off the U.S. Pacific Fleet by sinking 
                    its aircraft carriers. U.S. bombs falling in Tokyo, however ineffective,  gave him just what he needed to sell 
                    a plan to the Naval General Staff in Tokyo: attack the U.S. Naval Air Facility on tiny 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll" target="_blank">Midway Atoll</a> 
                    at the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Islands chain, about two-thirds of the way from Tokyo to Honolulu. Surely 
                    this would force the Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s carriers at Pearl Harbor (about 1100 nautical miles from Midway) out 
                    into the open where they could be destroyed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the details of Yamamoto's plan were worked out, 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_HYPO" target="_blank">U.S. Navy codebreakers in Hawaii</a> began 
                    to decode Japanese radio traffic concerning an objective for early June called &ldquo;AF.&rdquo; Suspecting 
                    that this might refer to Midway, Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief  
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_W._Nimitz" target="_blank">Admiral Chester Nimitz</a> instructed 
                    the commander there to broadcast an uncoded message indicating that the base&rsquo;s water purifiers had failed. 
                    The Japanese took the bait: they radioed instructions to load additional desalination equipment for AF. Now 
                    Nimitz knew where and when the attack would come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 27 May, about 75 ships of Yamamoto's Combined Fleet steamed from port in Japan bound for Midway, led by
