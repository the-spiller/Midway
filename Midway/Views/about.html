                <p>
                    Midway is is a two-player, turn-based, double-blind World War II historical simulation wargame. It 
                    is based on a landmark historical battle that began on 3 June 1942 between forces of the United
                    States Navy Pacific Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy Combined Fleet. It will give players an idea of the 
                    challenges facing the commanders of the opposing fleets, but without so much detail that it is difficult to 
                    learn to play. This is a balancing act that results in some historical elements being 
                    overlooked&mdash;for example, destroyers and submarines have been left out. The game system is not 
                    particularly original; it's been tweaked, but veteran board wargamers will recognize it immediately. Any 
                    changes we&rsquo;ve made were in an effort to take better advantage of this medium without losing too much 
                    of its old-time map-and-counters feel.

                    Each player takes a side: Japan&rsquo;s forces commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, or those of the United 
                    States under the overall command of Admiral Chester Nimitz. Players direct the movement and combat of the 
                    ships and aircraft actually present for the battle. The historical object is control of Midway Atoll. It 
                    begins the game in U.S. hands and can pay big dividends to the Japanese player if he or she can successfully 
                    capture it.

                <p>    
                    The game begins at 0500 3 June 1942 and is played in turns representing two hours in daylight and five 
                    hours at night. At 1700 on 6 June&mdash;34 turns later&mdash;time runs out. The game ends when the last 
                    turn is completed, when one player withdraws all of his or her ships from the map, or when a player chooses 
                    to retire. The winner is determined by points given for control of Midway and the destruction of enemy 
                    ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first glance, the game might appear to be a more sophisticated version of Battleship, and that&rsquo;s not 
                    far wrong. Most of the game is played on a map of the central Pacific around Midway Atoll where
                    neither player can see the other&rsquo;s ships. The map has a square grid that&rsquo;s 
                    used to control movement and determine range (each square scales to about 20 miles across). Players 
                    have a limited number of searches each turn that they use by selecting grid locations. When enemy ships are 
                    located they may be attacked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combat occurs in two ways. Usually it&rsquo;s one player launching planes from carriers to attack his 
                    or her opponent from the air. Should ships of both players wind up sharing one square on the map grid, 
                    ship-to-ship surface combat may ensue, but this is quite unusual (and never happened historically).

                    On the morning of 4 June 1942, Imperial Japan was winning its new war with the United States. By nightfall, 
                    that was no longer true.

                    The war began six months before in December, 1941 with a Japanese surprise attack on the U.S. Navy base

                    about 350 warplanes that sank 21 ships of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Pacific Fleet, 
                    announcing with convincing violence that a modern naval air arm trumped the traditional big-gun battleships 
                    of the world&rsquo;s navies. In one of those ironies that litter military history, the IJN&rsquo;s 
                    carrier-based attack came while the U.S. fleet&rsquo;s carriers and escorts were safely away from Pearl.

                    aircraft carriers. Doolittle&rsquo;s raid had given him just what he needed to sell an idea to the Naval 
                    General Staff: Operation &ldquo;MI,&rdquo; a plan to sieze the U.S. Naval Air Facility at tiny Midway Atoll 
                    near the northwestern end of the Hawaiian archipelago, about one-third of the way from Honolulu to 
                    Tokyo. This invasion would surely draw the Pacific Fleet out into the open where it could be

                    As the details for Yamamoto's plan were worked out, Pacific Fleet cryptographers at Pearl began 
                    to decode Japanese radio traffic concerning an objective for early June called &ldquo;AF.&rdquo; Suspecting 
                    that this might refer to Midway, Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief Admiral

                    The Japanese took the bait: they broadcast instructions to load additional desalination equipment for AF, 
                    and now Nimitz knew where and when the attack would come.
