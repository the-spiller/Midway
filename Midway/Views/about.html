                    The Game
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midway is is a two-player, turn-based, double-blind World War II historical simulation wargame. A simple one, as 
                    these things go. It's based on a landmark battle that occurred in early June, 1942 
                    between forces of the United States Navy (USN) Pacific Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Combined 
                    Fleet. It will give players an idea of the challenges that faced the commanders of the opposing fleets 
                    but without so much detail that it is difficult to learn to play. This is a balancing act that results in some 
                    historical elements being overlooked&mdash;for example, destroyers and submarines have been left out of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game system is not particularly original; it's been tweaked, but veteran board wargamers will recognize 
                    it immediately.
                </p>

                    Each player takes a side: Japan&rsquo;s forces commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, or those of the United 
                    States under the command of Admiral Chester Nimitz. Players direct the movement and combat of the 
                    ships and aircraft actually present for the battle (except, of course, those destroyers and submarines mentioned 
                    above).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first glance, the game might appear to be a sophisticated version of Battleship, and that&rsquo;s not far 
                    wrong. Most of the game is played on a map of the central Pacific around Midway Atoll on which each player 
                    sees only their own ships and aircraft. The map has a square grid (about 20 miles to a side) that&rsquo;s 
                    used to control movement and determine range. Players have a limited number of searches available each turn 
                    that they use by selecting grid locations. When enemy ships are located, only their types&mdash;battleship, 
                    aircraft carrier, light aircraft carrier, cruiser or light cruiser&mdash;are revealed. No infomation on the 
                    number of each type present is given, nor anything about any specific ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning at 0500 on 3 June 1942, the game is played in turns representing two hours in daylight and five hours 
                    at night. Time runs out 34 turns later at 1700 on 6 June. The game ends when this last turn is completed or 
                    when either player chooses to retire. The winner is determined by points given for control of Midway Atoll and 
                    the destruction of enemy ships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each turn is divided into phases in which players move their ships, search for their opponent, and plan and 
                    execute combat. Combat is of two types: air or surface. Usually it&rsquo;s air operations attack missions: sending 
                    aircraft that are available and in range to attack a grid square containing enemy ships. Ship-to-ship surface 
                    combat can occur when ships of both players wind up sharing one square on the map grid, but this is unusual 
                    (and never happened during the actual battle).

                    On the Home page, players are presented with a list of the games that they are participating in. Select one 
                    and press the Play button to pick it up where you left off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start a new game, select the &ldquo;New Game&rdquo; entry for the side you&rsquo;d like to play. If there's 
                    a specific opponent you&rsquo;r looking for, enter their nickname in the &ldquo;Optional opponent nickname&rdquo; 
                    text box. If you don&rsquo;t enter a nickname, the first player seeking a new game playing the other side will 
                    become your opponent. Click on the Play button to create the game and begin play. Once a new game is created, it is 
                    added to the list of available games and will appear there until completed, retired from or abandoned.

                    Midway is played in turns, and each turn consists of a series of phases with specific actions taken by each 
                    player. These phases are:

                        she will ever have); both players move any or all of their ships and ready (or de-ready) aircraft for operations.</li>

                    On the morning of 4 June 1942, Imperial Japan was winning its war with the United States. By lunchtime, 
                    it wasn&rsquo;t.

                    of the world&rsquo;s navies. In one of those ironies that litter military history, this demonstration 
                    of the effectiveness of naval air power came while the U.S. fleet&rsquo;s carriers were safely away from Pearl.

                    While America scrambled to assemble men and mat&#233;riel to fight this war, Thailand, Malaya, Hong Kong, Guam, 
                    Wake Island and the Philippines fell to Japanese invaders. Imperial Japan now threatened Australia and built 
                    up a strong protective screen for their 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere" target="_blank">
                    Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>. Should Hawaii fall, the Pacific Ocean might as well 
                    be a Japanese lake.

                <p>
                    Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen came to believe themselves invincible. Much like today&rsquo;s radical 
                    <span class="i">mujahideen</span>, they believed that Americans were spoiled and weak and lacked the will to 
                    fight.

                <p>        
                    In April, a bright spot emerged for the U.S. and her allies. A Pacific Fleet task force, including 
                    one of the aircraft carriers that the Pearl Harbor attack missed, snuck close to the Japanese home islands 
                    and launched sixteen Army B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers against Tokyo and other Japanese 
                    cities&mdash;the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" target="_blank">Doolittle Raid</a>. Little 
                    real damage was done, but the raid accomplished its primary goal of raising American morale at a time when it was 
                    at its lowest. More, it embarassed and enraged Japan&rsquo;s military leadership.

                <p>
                    Imperial Navy Combined Fleet  
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" target="_blank">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto</a> 
                    knew he must complete the job begun at Pearl Harbor&mdash;he must finish off the U.S. Pacific Fleet by sinking 
                    its aircraft carriers. U.S. bombs falling in Tokyo, however ineffective,  gave him just what he needed to sell 
                    a plan to the Naval General Staff in Tokyo: sieze the U.S. Naval Air Facility on tiny 
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll" target="_blank">Midway Atoll</a> 
                    at the northwestern end of the Hawaiian Islands chain, about two-thirds of the way from Tokyo to Honolulu. Surely 
                    this would force the Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s carriers at Pearl Harbor (about 1100 nautical miles from Midway) out 
                    into the open where they could be destroyed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Imperial Navy planners worked out the details of Yamamoto&rsquo;s plan, a group of  
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_HYPO" target="_blank">U.S. Navy codebreakers in Hawaii</a> began 
                    to decode Japanese radio traffic concerning an objective for early June called &ldquo;AF.&rdquo; Suspecting 
                    that this might refer to Midway, Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief  
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_W._Nimitz" target="_blank">Admiral Chester Nimitz</a> instructed 
                    the commander there to broadcast an uncoded message indicating that the base&rsquo;s water purifiers had failed. 
                    The Japanese took the bait: they radioed instructions to load additional desalination equipment for &ldquo;AF.&rdquo; 
                    Now Nimitz knew where and when the attack would come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 27 May, about 75 ships of Yamamoto&rsquo;s Combined Fleet steamed from port bound for Midway, led by the 
                    First Carrier Striking Force <span class="i">Kido Butai</span> and its two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one 
                    light cruiser, 12 destroyers, four fleet carriers and 228 warplanes. By 2 June, two Pacific Fleet task forces 
                    composed of 8 cruisers, 17 destroyers, three carriers and 232 aircraft lay in wait about 350 miles northwest 
                    of Midway. An additional 78 Navy and Marine warplanes were based on Midway, supported by 21 U.S. Army Air Corps 
                    bombers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elements of the approaching Japanese fleet are spotted by search aircraft from Midway on 3 June. Attacks by Army
                    bombers and PBY search planes jury-rigged with torpedos have no effect.
