        Battle of Midway Game
    </p>
    <p>
        Midway is is a two-player, turn-based, historical World War II simulation wargame. It recreates 
        a landmark historical battle&mdash;very few have had similar impact on their war&rsquo;s
        outcome. It gives players an idea of the challenges facing the commanders of the opposing fleets, 
        yet without so much detail that it is difficult to understand or begin to play. This is something 
        of a balancing act, and as a result some historical elements are overlooked (e.g. destroyers and 
        submarines have been left out). The game system is not very original; it's been tweaked, but veteran 
        board wargamers will recognize it immediately. Any changes we&rsquo;ve made were in an effort to 
        take better advantage of this medium without losing too much of its old-time map-and-counters feel.

    </div>
    <p>
        Each player takes a side: forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy Combined Fleet (IJN for short) commanded 
        by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, or two task forces of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet (USN) under the overall 
        command of Admiral Chester Nimitz. Players direct the movement and combat of the ships and aircraft 
        actually present for the battle. The the historical object is control of Midway Atoll. It begins the game 
        in U.S. hands and pays big dividends to the Japanese player if he or she can successfully capture it.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The game begins at 0500 3 June 1942 and is played in turns representing two hours (5 
        hours at night) through 1700 on 6 June&mdash;34 turns in all. The game ends when the last turn is 
        completed, when one player withdraws all of his or her ships from the map, or when a player chooses 
        to retire. The winner is determined by points given for control of Midway and destruction of enemy ships 
        and aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first glance, the game might appear to be a more complex version of Battleship, and that&rsquo;s not 
        far wrong. Most of the game is played on a map of the central Pacific around Midway Atoll where
        neither player can see the other's ships. The map has a grid of squares about 20 miles across that&rsquo;s 
        used to control movement and determine range. Players have a limited number of searches each turn they 
        use by selecting grid locations, and when enemy ships are located they may be attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Combat can occur in two ways. Usually it&rsquo;s one player launching planes from carriers to attack his 
        or her opponent from the air. Should ships of both players wind up sharing one 
        square on the map grid, ship-to-ship surface combat may ensue, though this is quite unlikely.

    </p>
    <p>
        On the morning of 4 June 1942, Imperial Japan was winning its new war with the United States. At 
        nightfall, the Americans were winning. The battle would linger on for two more days, but the Japanese 
        were forced back onto their heels and would stay there until the war ended in late summer 1945.

            Imperial Japan, 1942
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The war began with a Japanese surprise attack on the U.S. Navy base at 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" target="_blank">Pearl Harbor</a> six 
        months before. The Imperial Japanese Navy&rsquo;s aircraft carrier striking force 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Air_Fleet_(Imperial_Japanese_Navy)" target="_blank">
        <span class="i">Kido Butai</span></a> launched 
        about 350 warplanes that sank or crippled the battleships of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Pacific Fleet, 
        announcing with convincing violence that sea power now included air power. In one of those ironies that 
        litter military history, the IJN&rsquo;s carrier-based attack came while the U.S. 
        fleet&rsquo;s carriers and their escorting ships were safely away from Pearl. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, while America scrambled to assemble men and mat&#233;riel to fight this war, Japan's ground 
        and naval forces rampaged across the western Pacific, seizing Burma, Thailand, French Indochina, 
        British Malaya, the Philippines and more. They threatened India and Australia and provided
        a strong protective screen for what they deemed their 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere" target="_blank">
        &ldquo;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.&rdquo;</a>
        Men of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy believed themselves invincible, and not without reason. These 
        were very dark days for the United States and its allies.
    </p>
    <p>        
        In April a bright spot for the U.S. emerged when a Pacific Fleet task force&mdash;including one of the 
        aircraft carriers that the Pearl Harbor attack missed&mdash;snuck to within 650 nautical miles of the 
        Japanese home islands and launched sixteen Army B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers to attack 
        Tokyo and other Japanese cities. History knows this as the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" target="_blank">Doolittle Raid</a> 
        for the man who planned and led it, Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. Little damage was done, but the raid 
        accomplished its primary goal of raising American morale at a time when it was at its lowest. More, it 
        embarassed and enraged Japanese military leaders&mdash;<span class="i">how dare the Americans threaten 
        the life of the Emperor! And make me look like a fool!</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The raid gave Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto just what he needed to sell an audacious idea to Japan's Naval 
        General Staff: Operation MI. This was a plan to sieze the U.S. Navy base at tiny Midway Atoll, part of 
        the Hawaiian Islands chain about 1100 nautical miles northwest of Oahu. An invasion here would surely 
        draw the carriers of the Pacific Fleet out into open where they could <span class="i">finally</span> be 
        destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the details for Yamamoto's plan were worked out, Pacific Fleet cryptologists at Pearl began 
        to intercept Japanese radio traffic referring to an objective called &ldquo;AF.&rdquo; Suspecting that 
        this might refer to Midway, intelligence officers instructed the commanding officer of the base there 
        to send a message in the clear indicating that the base&rsquo;s
