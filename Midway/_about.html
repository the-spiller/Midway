        Overview
    </p>
    <p>
        This game recreates a landmark historical battle&mdash;very few have had similar impact on their war&rsquo;s
        outcome. It gives players an idea of the challenges facing the 
        commanders of the opposing fleets, yet without so much detail that it is 
        difficult to understand or begin to play. This is something of a balancing act, and as a result 
        some historical elements are overlooked (e.g. destroyers and submarines). The game system is not very 
        original; it's been tweaked, but veteran board wargamers will recognize it immediately. Any changes 
        we&rsquo;ve made were in an effort to take better advantage of this medium without losing too much of its 
        old-time map-and-counters feel.

            Midway Atoll in November 1941

    </div>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, this is a two-player turn-based World War II nautical historical simulation wargame. Each 
        player takes a side: forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy Combined Fleet under the overall command of 
        Admiral 
        Isoroku Yamamoto, or task forces of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet commanded by Admiral Chester Nimitz. 
        Players direct 
        the movement and combat of the ships and aircraft actually present for the battle (except destroyers or 
        submarines&mdash; too much detail). The the historical object is control of Midway Atoll. It begins the 
        game is U.S. hands 
        and pays big dividends to the Japanese player if he or she can take it&mdash;a difficult prospect. 
        Experienced 
        players will often forego a fight for Midway and instead attempt to smash the enemy with air attacks and 
        then end the game by exiting the map. The game begins at 0500 3 June 1942 and is played in turns 
        representing two hours (5 hours at night) through 1700 on 6 June&mdash;34 turns in all. The game is ended 
        when that last turn is completed, when one player withdraws all of his or her ships from the map, or 
        when a player chooses to retire, no longer able to win. The winner is determined by points given for 
        control of Midway and destruction of enemy ships and aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first glance, the game might appear to be a more complex version of Battleship, and that&rsquo;s not 
        entirely wrong. Most of the game is played on a map of the central Pacific around Midway Atoll, 
        where each players&rsquo; ships are invisible to the other. The map has a grid (squares about 20 miles 
        across) used to control movement and determine range. 
        Searches are made, and if enemy ships are located, they can be attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Combat can occur in two ways. Usually it&rsquo;s one player launching planes from carriers to attack his 
        or her opponent from the air. It's quite unlikely, but should ships of both players wind up sharing one 
        square on the map grid, ship-to-ship surface combat can ensue.

    <p>
        On the morning of 4 June 1942, the Japanese were winning their new war with America. By 
        lunchtime, it was the Americans who were winning.

        The Japanese surprise attack on 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" target="_blank">Pearl Harbor</a> 
        that began America&rsquo;s involvement in this war had occurred 
        just six months before. The Imperial Japanese Navy&rsquo;s aircraft carrier striking force 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Air_Fleet_(Imperial_Japanese_Navy)" target="_blank">
        <span class="i">Kido Butai</span></a> launched 
        350 warplanes that sank or crippled the battleships of the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s Pacific Fleet and announced 
        with convincing violence that sea power now included air power. In one of those ironies that litter 
        military history, the IJN&rsquo;s carrier-based attack came while the U.S. 
        fleet&rsquo;s carriers and their cruiser and destroyer escorts were safely away from Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then, Japan's naval and ground forces had rampaged across the western Pacific, seizing Burma, 
        Thailand, French Indochina, British Malaya, the Philippines and more, threatening Australia and providing 
        a strong protective screen for what they deemed their 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere" target="_blank">
        &ldquo;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.&rdquo;</a>
        The Imperial Japanese Army and Navy believed themselves invincible, and not without evidence. These were 
        very dark days for the United States and its allies.
    </p>
    <p>        
        In April a bright spot for the U.S. emerged when a Pacific Fleet task force&mdash;built around two of the 
        aircraft carriers that the Pearl Harbor attack missed&mdash;snuck to within 650 nautical miles of the 
        Japanese home islands and launched sixteen Army B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers  for a raid 
        on Tokyo. History knows this as the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" target="_blank">Doolittle Raid</a> 
        for the man who planned and led it, Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. Little damage was done, but the raid accomplished 
        its primary goal of raising American morale at a time when it was at its lowest. More, it embarassed and 
        enraged Japanese military leaders&mdash;how dare the Americans threaten the life of the Emperor! And make
        me look a fool in the process ...
    </p>
    <p>
        The raid gave Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto what he needed to sell an idea to the Naval General Staff: 
        Operation MI.
