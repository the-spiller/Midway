        U.S. Navy Torpedo Squadron Six (VT-6) Douglas TBD &ldquo;Devastator&rdquo; torpedo bombers are prepared for 
        launching on USS <span class="i">Enterprise</span> (CV-6) at about 0730-0740 hrs, 4 June 1942. Eleven of the fourteen TBDs 
        launched from <span class="i">Enterprise</span> are visible. Three more TBDs and ten F4F fighters must still be pushed 
        into position before launching will begin.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TBD in the left front is Number Two (Bureau # 1512), flown by Ensign Severin L. Rombach and 
        Aviation Radioman 2nd Class W.F. Glenn. Along with eight other VT-6 aircraft, this plane and its 
        crew were lost attacking Japanese aircraft carriers somewhat more than two hours later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The wake of USS <span class="i">Pensacola</span> (CA-24) is in the right distance and a destroyer is in 
        plane guard position at left.
