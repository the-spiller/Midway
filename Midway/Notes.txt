Buggy display of search marker and ships in marker's zone during search phase (OK after phase is advanced). Seems caused by 
draw/removal of zone highlight (which appears too late anyhow).

Occasional reload of last-loaded game when new game option selected.

Error in RemoveSearchMarkers during end of phase PUT -- remove stuff from a collection while looping through it

Try qTip2 for triggering tooltip display (they don't work on a touch screen)?
