OUTSTANDING
-----------

- mozilla: air readiness buttons clickable in Search Phase! And dirty flag set, too. (Cursor appearance appropriate)

- new game, select an opponent w/ game waiting for anyone to play your side: creates a new game instead of using opponent's existing one

- plays of sfxSailing after first, fade out callback fails (sfx plays to end)

- click on artwork on home page game selector does not select game (but DOES make buttons appear)
